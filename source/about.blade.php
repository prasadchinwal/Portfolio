        <p class="">I'm a full-stack developer at University of Illinois, Springfield. Currently living in Springfield, Illinois, United States of America ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.</p>

        <p class="">Originally from Goa, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, I came to United States to pursue higher degree (Master's in Computer Science) in Fall 2016.</p>

        <p class="">I like to learn new technologies and use them in production applications. Lately I have been spending a lot of time learning DevOps, in hopes of shifting my career towards DevOps. I am also working towards getting my AWS certification.</p>
